Android port of the pypicokey core (AGPL-3.0-or-later, (c) 2025 Pol Henarejos).

Only the pure-Python layers are kept; everything that touched PC/SC (pyscard)
or libusb (pyusb) is replaced by the transports in picokeyapp.ccid /
picokeyapp.ctap, which talk to the Android USB Host API through pyjnius.
