# buildozer translates android.features into p4a's `--feature` argument
# (buildozer/targets/android.py), and current python-for-android (>= 2024)
# removed `--feature`, so the build dies with:
#   toolchain.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --feature android.hardware.usb.host
# This is true for BOTH buildozer 1.5.0 and 1.6.0, so it cannot be fixed by
# pinning another buildozer version - the setting itself has to go.
#
# The same declaration is injected straight into <manifest> instead, which is
# what p4a supports today via --extra-manifest-xml.
